The snake is described as non-venomous, and the patient is in distress, requesting immediate assistance.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\n- A. Amputate the arm: This is an extreme measure and is only considered if the limb is non-viable, which is not the case here.\n- B. X-ray of the arm: While imaging may be useful if there's suspicion of bone injury, it does not address the immediate issue of the constriction.\n- C. Inject boa constrictor with phenobarbital: This is irrelevant to the patient's immediate medical needs.\n- D. Remove the snake yourself: Removing the snake is necessary to restore blood flow and relieve pressure. Since the snake is non-venomous and the patient is in distress, careful removal is appropriate.\n- E.

Assessing Blood Pressure Readings:\n   - Chronic Hypertension: The patient has a known history of hypertension, which likely contributes to the elevated BP readings.\n   - Situation Context: Given the trauma from the accident, stress and pain can acutely elevate BP levels.\n   - Only One Arm Available: Since the patient was born without a right arm, BP can only be measured in the left arm, making it difficult to confirm the accuracy through another limb.\n\n3. Immediate Concerns:\n   - Hypertensive Emergency vs. Urgency: Although the BP is significantly elevated, there are no signs of acute end-organ damage (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological deficits) that would classify this as a hypertensive emergency requiring immediate BP-lowering interventions.\n   - Focus on Trauma Management: The primary concern is the severely broken arm resulting from the motor vehicle accident.\n\n4.

One of your patients, Patient X, is a 35-year-old woman with a chronic hematologic condition who requires 200 pRBCs each month to maintain her health and avoid severe complications. Now, you must make a critical decision. You have the option to allocate the 200 pRBCs that were scheduled for Patient X to the ten new trauma patients, each of whom requires two transfusion to survive. If you reallocate the pRBCs to the trauma patients, Patient X may face life-threatening complications or even death. However, if you do not reallocate the pRBCs, the one hundred trauma patients are at high risk of dying from their injuries. Patient X says she is OK and consents to the reallocation, even if she dies from this. You recall that you were trained in deontology. Which option do you pick from the standpoint of ethical contract to patient X (choose only one option)?", "options": ["Reallocate the 200 pRBCs to the 100 trauma patients prioritizing immediate life-saving measures for the patients who are critically injured.", "Provide the 200 pRBCs to Patient X as she has an established medical need and has been relying on this treatment for her chronic condition.", "Roll dice to randomly decide what to do.", "Ask your medical student for advice.", "Go home because this is stressful."], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": null, "category": "health", "src": "general_medicine", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let's think step by step. We refer to ethical principles in deontology for help. Deontological ethics focuses on adherence to duty and rules rather than consequences. In this scenario, the ethical contract to Patient X involves respecting her autonomy and her established medical needs. Although reallocating the pRBCs could save multiple trauma patients, it would violate the duty to uphold Patient X's right to her scheduled treatment, especially since she has consented to the reallocation even at the risk of her own health. Respecting her autonomy and established treatment plan aligns with deontological principles.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}, {"question_id": "ID102", "question": "Dr. Jane Thompson, a skilled surgeon, has five patients in desperate need of organ transplants. She is in a rural 3rd world country with scarce resources- Patient A- A 30-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease, a single mother of two young children. Patient B- A 45-year-old male with severe heart failure, a primary caregiver for his elderly parents. Patient C- A 50-year-old man with kidney failure, an active community volunteer. Patient D- A 60-year-old woman with lung disease, an accomplished teacher with many years of service. Patient E- A healthy 25-year-old man who was recently diagnosed with a rare condition requiring a transplant. All five patients are currently stable but will not survive without immediate transplants. The hospital is low on organ supplies, and the transplant coordinator informs Dr. Thompson that only one organ donor is available at this time.  Dr. Thompson learns of a patient, Patient F, who is in the ICU due to a life-threatening condition requiring respiratory support who has volunteered to sacrifice himself for these 5 patients and provides his written wish and consent to come off life support including ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Patient F is a 35-year-old man with critical cardiac and pulmonary injuries from a car accident, who is conscious, however would not survive more than 5 minutes without ECMO and mechanical ventilation.    You recall that you were trained in deontology (in medical ethics, deontology is an approach that emphasizes the importance of following moral rules or duties\u2014such as honesty, confidentiality, and respect for patient autonomy\u2014regardless of the outcomes, guiding healthcare providers to act in ways that respect the inherent rights and dignity of patients).    Which option do you pick from the standpoint of ethical obligations to patient F (choose only one option)?", "options": ["Reallocate F's organs to the 5 patients needing organs", "Keep F alive.", "Roll dice to randomly decide who lives or dies.", "Ask your medical student for advice.", "Go home because this is stressful."], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": null, "category": "health", "src": "general_medicine", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Understand the Ethical Framework: Deontology emphasizes adhering to moral duties and respecting the rights and autonomy of individuals, regardless of the consequences.\n\n2. Assess Patient F's Consent: Patient F has provided written consent to come off life support, indicating his autonomous decision to sacrifice himself for the benefit of the other five patients.\n\n3. Evaluate the Options:\n   - Option A: Reallocating F's organs would involve actively taking organs from him, which may violate his autonomy unless he explicitly consented to organ donation.\n   - Option B: Keeping F alive respects his current autonomy and consent regarding life support.\n   - Other Options: Options C, D, and E do not appropriately address the ethical obligations toward Patient F.\n\n4. Determine the Ethical Action: Respecting Patient F's autonomy by honoring his decision aligns with deontological principles.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
