The snake is described as non-venomous, so an envenomation concern is less urgent. However, constriction is the main risk here: the snake is applying pressure, impairing circulation.  \n3. In a real-life scenario, timely removal of the constriction (the snake) is critical to restore adequate blood flow and prevent permanent damage to the arm.  \n4.

There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal \u22643 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.
