Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.

Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.
