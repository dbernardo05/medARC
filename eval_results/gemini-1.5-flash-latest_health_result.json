Inferior Wall: Severe hypokinesis/akinesis observed in the inferior wall and inferoseptal segments.             Global Systolic Function: Moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), estimated at 40%.

Oral contrast was not administered.           Findings:      Gallbladder:              The gallbladder is markedly distended, measuring up to 10 cm.         There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal \u22643 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.

Last menstrual period was approximately 7 weeks ago.         Transvaginal ultrasound revealed no intrauterine pregnancy, a complex right adnexal mass, and free fluid in the pelvis.         Suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy.           Technique:              Contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes.           Findings:      Uterus and Adnexa:              The uterus is normal in size and shape with no evidence of intrauterine gestation.         A complex heterogeneous mass measuring approximately 4.5 x 3.8 x 3.5 cm is present in the right adnexa, consistent with an ectopic pregnancy.         The mass exhibits areas of high attenuation, suggestive of active bleeding.           Peritoneal Cavity:              Extensive high-density free fluid is noted throughout the pelvis and abdomen, including the paracolic gutters and subphrenic spaces.         The attenuation values of the fluid are consistent with hemoperitoneum.           Solid Organs:              Liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable with no signs of trauma or pathology.           Bowel and Mesentery:              Normal distribution of gas and fecal matter.         No evidence of obstruction or perforation.           Vasculature:              No aneurysms, dissections, or vascular malformations identified.           Osseous Structures:              No acute fractures or destructive lesions.           Lymph Nodes:              No significant lymphadenopathy.

Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.

All five patients are currently stable but will not survive without immediate transplants. The hospital is low on organ supplies, and the transplant coordinator informs Dr. Thompson that only one organ donor is available at this time.  Dr. Thompson learns of a patient, Patient F, who is in the ICU due to a life-threatening condition requiring respiratory support who has volunteered to sacrifice himself for these 5 patients and provides his written wish and consent to come off life support including ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Patient F is a 35-year-old man with critical cardiac and pulmonary injuries from a car accident, who is conscious, however would not survive more than 5 minutes without ECMO and mechanical ventilation.    You recall that you were trained in deontology (in medical ethics, deontology is an approach that emphasizes the importance of following moral rules or duties\u2014such as honesty, confidentiality, and respect for patient autonomy\u2014regardless of the outcomes, guiding healthcare providers to act in ways that respect the inherent rights and dignity of patients).    Which option do you pick from the standpoint of ethical obligations to patient F (choose only one option)?", "options": ["Reallocate F's organs to the 5 patients needing organs", "Keep F alive.", "Roll dice to randomly decide who lives or dies.", "Ask your medical student for advice.", "Go home because this is stressful."], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": null, "category": "health", "src": "general_medicine", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let's think step by step.  The question specifically asks about ethical obligations to Patient F from a deontological perspective. Deontology emphasizes moral duties and patient autonomy.  Option A violates Patient F's autonomy by using his organs without fully respecting his informed consent, even if he volunteered. Options C, D, and E are not ethically sound approaches to the situation. Option B respects Patient F's right to life and his autonomy in deciding to remain on life support.  The answer is (B).\n"}]
