MRI Brain to rule out acute ischemic stroke: While an MRI can provide detailed information, it is not the immediate next step in an acute setting where a stroke is suspected.\n   - C. Discuss airway/pulmonary status with ICU team: Given the patient's intubation and low SpO2, addressing airway and pulmonary status is critical, but it may not directly address the stroke evaluation.\n   - D. tPA: Similar to tenecteplase, tPA is a thrombolytic agent, and the patient is outside the treatment window.\n   - E. CT Head to rule out acute hemorrhagic stroke: A non-contrast CT head is the standard initial imaging study to rule out hemorrhagic stroke in the acute setting. It is quick and can help determine if the patient is having a hemorrhagic stroke, which would contraindicate thrombolytic therapy.\n\nConsidering the acute presentation and the need to rule out hemorrhagic stroke before any further management, the next best action is to perform a CT Head.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}, {"question_id": "ID043", "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of severe, crushing chest pain that radiates to his left arm and jaw.

The patient is presenting with signs of septic shock: altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, cool and clammy skin, delayed capillary refill, elevated lactate, and leukocytosis. \n\nIn septic shock, after initial fluid resuscitation (which has already been attempted with 2 liters of normal saline), the next step is typically to start vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion. Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor for septic shock.\n\nHowever, the patient currently has no IV access, as EMS reports he lost IV access en route. Therefore, before administering any medications, it is crucial to establish IV access. Without IV access, we cannot administer norepinephrine or any other IV medications.\n\nGiven the options, the most immediate and necessary step is to re-establish IV access to allow for further treatment, including the administration of vasopressors. \n\nTherefore, the next best step in management is to insert a peripheral IV.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}, {"question_id": "ID070", "question": "A 36-year-old male with a known history of epilepsy arrives at the emergency department in status epilepticus, having experienced continuous generalized tonic-clonic seizures for over 20 minutes despite taking his regular antiseizure medication, clobazam.

The duty to fulfill the established medical contract with Patient X takes precedence over the potential benefit to the trauma patients, as deontology focuses on the morality of actions based on adherence to rules or duties rather than the consequences of those actions.\n\nTherefore, from the standpoint of ethical contract to Patient X, the correct option is to provide the 200 pRBCs to Patient X as she has an established medical need and has been relying on this treatment for her chronic condition.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}, {"question_id": "ID102", "question": "Dr. Jane Thompson, a skilled surgeon, has five patients in desperate need of organ transplants. She is in a rural 3rd world country with scarce resources- Patient A- A 30-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease, a single mother of two young children. Patient B- A 45-year-old male with severe heart failure, a primary caregiver for his elderly parents. Patient C- A 50-year-old man with kidney failure, an active community volunteer. Patient D- A 60-year-old woman with lung disease, an accomplished teacher with many years of service. Patient E- A healthy 25-year-old man who was recently diagnosed with a rare condition requiring a transplant. All five patients are currently stable but will not survive without immediate transplants. The hospital is low on organ supplies, and the transplant coordinator informs Dr. Thompson that only one organ donor is available at this time.  Dr. Thompson learns of a patient, Patient F, who is in the ICU due to a life-threatening condition requiring respiratory support who has volunteered to sacrifice himself for these 5 patients and provides his written wish and consent to come off life support including ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Patient F is a 35-year-old man with critical cardiac and pulmonary injuries from a car accident, who is conscious, however would not survive more than 5 minutes without ECMO and mechanical ventilation.    You recall that you were trained in deontology (in medical ethics, deontology is an approach that emphasizes the importance of following moral rules or duties\u2014such as honesty, confidentiality, and respect for patient autonomy\u2014regardless of the outcomes, guiding healthcare providers to act in ways that respect the inherent rights and dignity of patients).    Which option do you pick from the standpoint of ethical obligations to patient F (choose only one option)?", "options": ["Reallocate F's organs to the 5 patients needing organs", "Keep F alive.", "Roll dice to randomly decide who lives or dies.", "Ask your medical student for advice.", "Go home because this is stressful."], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": null, "category": "health", "src": "general_medicine", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the ethical framework of deontology, which emphasizes following moral rules and duties. In this scenario, Dr. Thompson is faced with a decision regarding Patient F, who has volunteered to sacrifice himself for the benefit of five other patients. However, from a deontological perspective, the primary focus is on respecting the inherent rights and dignity of each patient, including Patient F.\n\n1. Respect for Autonomy: Patient F has expressed a wish to sacrifice himself, which is an exercise of his autonomy. However, deontological ethics also requires that we consider the moral rules and duties involved, such as the duty to preserve life.\n\n2. Duty to Preserve Life: One of the fundamental duties in medical ethics is to preserve life. This duty would suggest that Dr. Thompson should not actively participate in ending Patient F's life, even if he has consented to it.\n\n3. Non-Maleficence: This principle involves the duty to do no harm. Actively ending Patient F's life would be considered causing harm, which is contrary to this principle.\n\n4. Moral Rules and Duties: Deontological ethics emphasizes following moral rules, such as not killing an innocent person, regardless of the potential outcomes or benefits to others.\n\nGiven these considerations, the deontological approach would likely lead Dr. Thompson to prioritize the duty to preserve life and respect the moral rule against actively ending a life. Therefore, the ethical obligation to Patient F, from a deontological standpoint, would be to keep him alive.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
