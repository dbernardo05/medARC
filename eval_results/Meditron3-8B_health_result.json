This is because the patient's condition is rare and may require specialized care. Additionally, the patient's anticoagulation therapy and abdominal pain may have other causes that need to be ruled out.\n\n### Why Not the Other Options?\n\n- CT Scan to rule out bleed (A): While a CT scan may be useful in diagnosing gastrointestinal bleeding, it is not the best initial step in this case. The patient's condition and lack of bloody stool or tarry stool make this less likely.\n- KUB (B): A KUB (kidneys, ureters, and bladder) x-ray may be useful in diagnosing kidney stones or other urinary tract issues, but it is not the best initial step in this case.\n- Enema (D): An enema may be useful in diagnosing gastrointestinal issues, but it is not the best initial step in this case.\n- Gastric Bypass (E): A gastric bypass is a surgical procedure that is not indicated in this case.\n\n### Answer:\nC.

Individuals with this condition often walk on their hands.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe patient presents with syncope and dizziness, which are symptoms of poor perfusion. When standing on his hands, his systolic blood pressure in the leg is critically low at 100 mm Hg, indicating poor perfusion.\n\n### Initial Assessment\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the initial assessment is crucial. The patient's blood pressure is critically low, and he is tachycardic, indicating poor perfusion.\n\n### Best Course of Action\n\nThe best course of action is to re-examine the patient in a supine position. This is because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are likely due to orthostatic hypotension, which is a common cause of syncope and dizziness in individuals with situs inversus verticalis syndrome.\n\n### Why Re-examine in Supine Position?\n\nRe-examining the patient in a supine position will allow for a more accurate assessment of his blood pressure and perfusion status. This is because the patient's inverted body position may be contributing to his symptoms, and repositioning him in a supine position may alleviate these symptoms.\n\n### Other Options\n\n- IV access and IVF bolus (A): While IV access and fluid resuscitation may be necessary, it is not the best initial course of action.\n- Echocardiogram (B): An echocardiogram may be necessary to evaluate the patient's cardiac function, but it is not the best initial course of action.\n- Defibrillation (D): Defibrillation is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of cardiac arrhythmia.\n- Cardiac pacing (E): Cardiac pacing is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of cardiac conduction abnormalities.\n\n### Answer:\nC.

Aspirin\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\n### Situs Inversus Verticalis Syndrome\n\nSitus inversus verticalis syndrome is a novel condition characterized by the recalibration of vestibular centers, causing individuals to perceive their body as inverted. This leads to a preference for doing handstands, where the head is at the bottom of the body and the feet are at the top.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n\nThe patient, a 70-year-old with an aortic aneurysm, presents with acute syncope and dizziness while attempting to stand up. Upon assessment in the handstand position, the patient's systolic blood pressure is significantly elevated at 280 mm Hg, and he exhibits symptoms of poor perfusion with reduced pulse pressure in his feet.\n\n### Echocardiogram Findings\n\nThe echocardiogram reveals elevated resistive indices, indicating increased peripheral resistance.\n\n### Uncertainty in Situs Inversus Verticalis Syndrome Physiology\n\nGiven the lack of guidance in the resident cardiac textbook, the best course of action is crucial.\n\n### Best Course of Action\n\nThe correct answer is C. Re-examine in supine position.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe patient's symptoms and elevated blood pressure are likely due to the handstand position, which may be causing a significant increase in peripheral resistance. Re-examining the patient in the supine position will allow for a more accurate assessment of his hemodynamic status and may help to alleviate his symptoms.\n\n### Why Not the Other Options?\n\n- A. Beta-blocker: While beta-blockers may help to reduce blood pressure, they do not address the underlying issue of the handstand position.\n- B. Echocardiogram: While an echocardiogram can provide valuable information, it is not the immediate next step in this scenario.\n- D. Vagal maneuvers: Vagal maneuvers, such as the Valsalva maneuver, may help to reduce blood pressure, but they do not address the underlying issue of the handstand position.\n- E. Aspirin: Aspirin is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms are likely due to the handstand position rather than an acute coronary syndrome.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRe-examining the patient in the supine position is the best course of action to accurately assess his hemodynamic status and alleviate his symptoms."}, {"question_id": "ID015", "question": "You are in the emergency room evaluating a 50 year old with new condition called situs inversus verticalis syndrome, which causes acute superior to inferior whole-body inversion (e.g. head is at bottom of body and feet are at top of body); these individuals often walk on their hands.

Obtain more clinical information\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. Patient Profile: The patient is a 40-year-old male who has undergone multiple cardiac surgeries, including cardiac removal, and is now dependent on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). His previous heart is bypassed and effectively separated from his vascular circuit.\n\n2. Clinical Presentation: The patient is acutely unresponsive with acute hypotension. The cardiac monitor shows ventricular fibrillation (VF).\n\n3. VF in ECMO Patient: In a patient on ECMO, ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening condition. However, the ECMO circuit is designed to provide cardiac support, and the patient's previous heart is bypassed and effectively separated from the vascular circuit. This means that the ECMO circuit is taking over the function of the heart.\n\n4. Best Course of Action: Given that the ECMO circuit is providing cardiac support, the patient's previous heart is not functioning, and the VF is not a result of cardiac activity, the best course of action is to defibrillate the patient. This is because the VF is not a result of cardiac activity, but rather a result of the ECMO circuit's inability to provide adequate cardiac support.\n\n5. Why Not CPR or Epinephrine?: CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and epinephrine are typically used to treat cardiac arrest in patients with a functioning heart. However, in this case, the patient's previous heart is bypassed and effectively separated from the vascular circuit, and the ECMO circuit is taking over the function of the heart. Therefore, CPR and epinephrine would not be effective in this scenario.\n\n6. Why Not Pacing?: Pacing is typically used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) or asystole (flatline on the EKG). However, in this case, the patient is in ventricular fibrillation, which is a different arrhythmia that requires defibrillation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the patient's profile, clinical presentation, and the fact that the ECMO circuit is providing cardiac support, the best course of action is to defibrillate the patient.\n\n### Answer:\nA.

CT Head to rule out acute hemorrhagic stroke\nC. CTA Head to rule out aneurysm\nD. Discharge to home\nE. Administer tenecteplase\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Assess the patient's symptoms and history\nThe patient is a 70.027-year-old male presenting with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and speech alteration. He was last known to be normal 2 hours ago, before he used helium to blow up balloons. He now notes that his voice is higher than usual.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the possible causes of the patient's symptoms\nThe patient's symptoms of speech alteration and voice pitch change could be due to a stroke. However, the use of helium to blow up balloons is a crucial clue. Helium is a known cause of high-pitched voice due to its effect on the vocal cords.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the patient's NIHSS score\nThe patient's NIHSS score is 1 due to his voice pitch change. This is a relatively low score, indicating that the patient's symptoms may not be severe.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the next best action\nGiven the patient's symptoms and history, the next best action is to rule out an acute hemorrhagic stroke. This is because the patient's symptoms could be due to a stroke, and a CT Head is the best imaging modality to rule out an acute hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the other options\n- MRI Brain (Option A): While an MRI Brain could be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, it is not the best initial imaging modality in this case.\n- CTA Head (Option C): A CTA Head is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of an aneurysm.\n- Discharge to home (Option D): Discharging the patient to home is not appropriate, as he has symptoms that could be due to a stroke.\n- Administer tenecteplase (Option E): Administering tenecteplase is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant thrombolysis.\n\n### Answer:\nB.

Presenting with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and elevated lactate.         High clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia.           Findings:      1. Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.         Multiple loops of bowel show intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), a concerning sign for bowel infarction.         Gas is also seen within the mesenteric veins and branches of the portal vein (portomesenteric venous gas), further indicating advanced ischemia.           2.

He appears agitated and disoriented, sweating profusely, and struggling to maintain his balance.\n\n### Vital Signs\n- Blood pressure: 130/110 mmHg\n- Heart rate: 140 bpm\n- Oxygen saturation: 80% on room air\n\n### Examination Findings\n- Pupils are dilated\n- Exhibits both horizontal and vertical nystagmus\n- Significant ataxia\n- Unable to perform finger-to-nose testing\n- Slurred speech\n- Unable to follow simple commands\n- Denies any past medical history and is not currently taking any medications\n- No signs of physical trauma\n\n### Clinical Condition\nThe patient is experiencing an acute psychotic episode, as evidenced by his delusions (believing he has the power to control the weather), disorganized behavior (attempting to direct traffic with erratic hand gestures), and disorganized speech (slurred speech and inability to follow commands). His vital signs indicate hypertension and tachycardia, which are consistent with a sympathetic hyperactivity state often seen in acute psychosis.\n\n### Urgency of the Situation\nThe patient's agitation and disorientation pose a significant risk to himself and others. He is struggling to maintain his balance, which increases the risk of falls and injury. His delusions and disorganized behavior also pose a risk to public safety.\n\n### Management Options\n- A. Administer haloperidol 5mg IM: Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that can help manage acute psychosis. However, the patient's oxygen saturation is critically low at 80%, which is a more immediate concern.\n- B. Administer lorazepam 2mg IM: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can help manage agitation and anxiety. However, it may not be sufficient to address the patient's critical oxygen saturation.\n- C. Obtain a urine toxicology screen: While a toxicology screen may be useful in identifying potential underlying causes of the patient's symptoms, it is not the most urgent step in management.\n- D. Administer oxygen: The patient's oxygen saturation is critically low at 80%, which is a more immediate concern than his acute psychosis. Administering oxygen is essential to prevent further complications.\n- E. Restrain the patient and place him in a seclusion room: Restraint and seclusion may be necessary to ensure the patient's safety and the safety of others. However, this is not the most urgent step in management.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe patient's critically low oxygen saturation is the most urgent concern.

EMS reports he lost IV access en route. His wife reports that he had \"flu-like symptoms\" for the past two days, but this morning he became increasingly confused and was unable to get out of bed.\n\n### Examination Findings\n- Febrile (39.4\u00b0C)\n- Tachycardic (heart rate of 120 beats per minute)\n- Tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute)\n- Blood pressure is 78/42 mmHg despite receiving 2 liters of normal saline prior to arrival during EMS transfer\n- Skin is cool and clammy, and capillary refill is delayed at 4 seconds\n\n### Laboratory Results\n- Elevated lactate level of 4.8 mmol/L\n- Leukocytosis\n\n### Clinical Implications\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with septic shock, characterized by:\n- Hypotension (BP 78/42 mmHg)\n- Tachycardia (HR 120 beats/min)\n- Tachypnea (RR 30 breaths/min)\n- Altered mental status\n- Cool and clammy skin\n- Delayed capillary refill\n- Elevated lactate level (4.8 mmol/L)\n\n### Management of Septic Shock\nThe management of septic shock involves the following steps:\n- Fluid Resuscitation: The patient has already received 2 liters of normal saline, but this is not sufficient to restore adequate circulation.\n- Vasopressor Therapy: The patient requires vasopressor therapy to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion of vital organs.\n\n### Vasopressor Therapy\nNorepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice for septic shock. It is a potent vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure and improves perfusion of vital organs.\n\n### Administration of Norepinephrine\nNorepinephrine can be administered through an IV line. The correct method of administration is to inject norepinephrine into an IV bag, then infuse it. This allows for a controlled and continuous administration of the vasopressor.\n\n### Other Options\n- Order a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (B): This is not the next best step in management. The patient's presentation is consistent with septic shock, and immediate management is required.\n- Administer acetaminophen to reduce fever (C): This is not the next best step in management. The patient's fever is a symptom of sepsis, and reducing it is not a priority at this time.\n- Begin norepinephrine infusion by injecting norepinephrine from vials into IV (A): This is not the correct method of administration. Norepinephrine should be injected into an IV bag, then infused.\n- Insert a peripheral IV (E): This is not the next best step in management. The patient already has an IV line, and the priority is to administer norepinephrine.\n\n### Answer:\nD. Begin norepinephrine infusion by injecting norepinephrine into IV bag then infusing"}, {"question_id": "ID074", "question": "A 36-year-old male with a known history of HIV/AIDS arrives at the emergency department in septic shock, having experienced persistent symptoms for over 20 hours despite being on his regular prophylactic antibiotic regimen, Medication A.

He also has a history of heavy smoking and reports occasional wheezing and shortness of breath. His chief complaint is hoarseness sensation when using his Passy-muir valve, which is anatomically typically below the larynx. On examination, he is experiencing mild wheezing.\n\n### New Flu-like Virus (D)\n\nThere is a new flu-like virus that is known to cause acute laryngeal inflammation and voice changes, with initial weak indicators including hoarseness.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis\n\nGiven the patient's history and symptoms, we need to consider the following possibilities:\n\n- Laryngeal Cancer: The patient's history of heavy smoking and hoarseness sensation could suggest laryngeal cancer. However, the patient's age and the fact that he has been unable to speak since age 5 make this less likely.\n- Vocal Cord Paralysis: The patient's history of larynx removal and the use of a Passy-muir valve suggest that he may have vocal cord paralysis. However, the new flu-like virus could also cause vocal cord inflammation and paralysis.\n- Respiratory Infection: The patient's wheezing and shortness of breath could suggest a respiratory infection, which could be caused by the new flu-like virus.\n\n### Best Course of Action\n\nGiven the patient's history and symptoms, the best course of action is to administer supportive care for respiratory symptoms and monitor response to treatment. This is because:\n\n- The patient's history of larynx removal and chronic inability to speak make it unlikely that he has laryngeal cancer.\n- The patient's use of a Passy-muir valve suggests that he may have vocal cord paralysis, but the new flu-like virus could also cause vocal cord inflammation and paralysis.\n- The patient's wheezing and shortness of breath could suggest a respiratory infection, which could be caused by the new flu-like virus.\n\n### Answer:\nE.

Device Explanation:\n   - The patient has an MRI-compatible noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation device on his right temple.\n   - This device is used to augment his lower extremity motor strength, which is similar to his pre-augmentation strength.\n\n3. Patient Concerns:\n   - The patient is concerned about having a stroke, given his history and current symptoms.\n   - He is worried about the strength of his lower extremities and asks if he is having a stroke.\n\n4. Vital Signs and Exam Findings:\n   - Blood pressure is elevated at 160/90.\n   - Lower extremity strength is weaker than expected for a 30.028 year-old but similar to that of a 60-70.018 year-old.\n   - NIHSS is 4 for dysarthria.\n\n5. Labs and Review of Systems:\n   - Labs are notable only for elevated fasting lipids.\n   - Review of systems includes headache and dysarthria.\n\n6. Patient's Request:\n   - The patient requests a CT Head, stating \"Time is brain!\" and that he is willing to donate $10 million for a new hospital wing if he is treated right.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n\n- A. Aspirin: Aspirin is not the best immediate next step in this scenario. While it may be useful in the management of stroke, it is not the most critical step in this situation.\n\n- B. EKG: An EKG is not directly relevant to the patient's current presentation of possible stroke.\n\n- C. CT Head: A CT Head is the best immediate next step. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible stroke, and a CT Head is necessary to rule out hemorrhagic stroke, which would be a contraindication for thrombolytic therapy.\n\n- D. Check his device: While the device is an interesting aspect of the patient's presentation, it is not the most critical step in this situation.\n\n- E. Inquire into his philanthropy history: Inquiring into the patient's philanthropy history is not directly relevant to his current medical situation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, history, and request, the best immediate next step is to perform a CT Head to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and guide further management.\n\n### Answer:\nC.

She has five patients in desperate need of organ transplants, but only one organ donor is available. Patient F, a 35-year-old man, has volunteered to sacrifice himself for these five patients and has provided written consent to come off life support, including ECMO and mechanical ventilation. However, Patient F would not survive more than 5 minutes without this support.\n\n#### Ethical Obligations\n\nIn this scenario, we need to consider the ethical obligations to Patient F. Deontology, an approach in medical ethics, emphasizes the importance of following moral rules or duties, such as honesty, confidentiality, and respect for patient autonomy. From this standpoint, we must consider the inherent rights and dignity of Patient F.\n\n#### Options Analysis\n\n- Option A: Reallocate F's organs to the 5 patients needing organs\n  - This option involves using Patient F's organs to save the lives of five other patients. However, it would require withdrawing life support from Patient F, which would likely result in his death.\n  - From a deontological perspective, this option raises concerns about respecting Patient F's autonomy and dignity.\n\n- Option B: Keep F alive\n  - This option involves continuing life support for Patient F, which would likely prolong his life.\n  - From a deontological perspective, this option respects Patient F's autonomy and dignity by allowing him to make decisions about his own life and death.\n\n- Option C: Roll dice to randomly decide who lives or dies\n  - This option involves using a random process to determine who receives the organ and who does not.\n  - From a deontological perspective, this option raises concerns about respecting Patient F's autonomy and dignity.\n\n- Option D: Ask your medical student for advice\n  - This option involves seeking advice from a medical student, which may not be appropriate in a situation where a medical professional is responsible for making life-or-death decisions.\n  - From a deontological perspective, this option raises concerns about respecting Patient F's autonomy and dignity.\n\n- Option E: Go home because this is stressful\n  - This option involves avoiding the decision altogether by leaving the situation.\n  - From a deontological perspective, this option raises concerns about respecting Patient F's autonomy and dignity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the most ethical option from a deontological perspective is to respect Patient F's autonomy and dignity by allowing him to make decisions about his own life and death. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n### Answer:\nB. Keep F alive."}]
