However, given that the patient is on an airplane and the location of medical facilities is unknown, it's best to prioritize cardiac catheterization if available.\n\nOption E, \"Order a chest X-ray to rule out aortic dissection,\" is not indicated in this scenario because the patient's clinical presentation and ECG results do not suggest aortic dissection.\n\nThe answer is (C)."}, {"question_id": "ID046", "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of abdominal pain that began around her umbilicus and has since migrated to the right lower quadrant.

The patient is an elderly man with altered mental status, fever, difficulty breathing, tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure, elevated lactate level, and leukocytosis. These symptoms are indicative of septic shock. The patient's low blood pressure and elevated lactate level suggest poor perfusion of vital organs. The patient's cool and clammy skin and delayed capillary refill also suggest poor circulation.\n\nGiven the patient's poor circulation and shock state, it is essential to start vasopressor therapy to increase blood pressure. However, it is crucial to have a reliable IV line to administer the medication safely. The correct answer should prioritize improving circulation and addressing the shock state. Option A and D both recommend starting norepinephrine infusion. However, it is essential to have a reliable IV line to administer the medication. Option A is less accurate because injecting a vial directly into an IV line may lead to uneven delivery.

The patient's main concern is that their augmented vision (using a headband and specialized glasses) has acutely stopped working, and they're worried about having a stroke. However, the patient's symptoms and the initial examination don't strongly indicate an acute stroke. The patient's history includes chronic dysarthria and migraines, and the current BP is within a relatively normal range for someone with hypertension. The neurological exam shows some abnormalities like mild intermittent esotropia and decreased vision (20/40), but sensation and strength are normal, and reflexes are 2+ throughout.\n\nGiven the sudden loss of function of the patient's augmented vision system, the first step would be to assess whether the issue is with the technology itself or a new medical condition. However, since the question seems to be guiding towards a medical intervention rather than troubleshooting the technology, we should consider the potential for a condition that could cause sudden loss of function in the visual system that the patient's technology relies on. \n\nThe options provided don't directly address troubleshooting the technology, so we'll interpret them in the context of ruling out serious medical conditions. The best next step in the emergency department for someone whose main concern is sudden loss of function (in this case, of their augmented vision) would typically be to rule out serious conditions such as a stroke or another acute neurological issue. \n\nBetween the options provided (A. Aspirin, B. EKG, C. MRI Brain, D. None of these options are correct, E.

Her temperature is 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C), heart rate is 105 beats per minute, blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 80%. Laboratory tests reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15,000/mm\u00b3. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant demonstrates gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and gallstones. Blood cultures are pending. Her CT Report and Surgeon Consult are as follows: CT Abdomen and Pelvis Report      Examination: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis.      Clinical Indication: 42-year-old female presenting with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Evaluate for complications and need for emergent surgical intervention.      Technique:              Axial and multiplanar reformatted images were obtained from the diaphragm to the pelvis after the intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material.         Oral contrast was not administered.           Findings:      Gallbladder:              The gallbladder is markedly distended, measuring up to 10 cm.         There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal \u22643 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.         Multiple radiodense gallstones are present within the gallbladder lumen, with one calculus impacted at the gallbladder neck/cystic duct region.         Pericholecystic fluid collections are evident surrounding the gallbladder.         There is significant inflammatory fat stranding in the pericholecystic region.

A at 0000 and 1200, B at 0001 and 1201, C at 0600 and 1800: This schedule does not properly address the need for a 12-hour spacing between the administration times of A and B, as they are given almost at the same time.\n\nB. A at 0000 and 1200, B at 1305 and 1300, C at 0600 and 1800: This schedule does not address the concern properly either, as the times given for B (1305 and 1300) are close to each other and do not properly align with A's schedule for maximum synergy.\n\nC. A at 0000 and 1200, B at 0204 and 1400, C at 0600 and 1800: This does not properly address the concern since B's times are not aligned properly with A's for maximum synergy.\n\nD. A at 0000 and 1204, B at 0303 and 1500, C at 0600 and 1800: This does not properly address the concern since the times are not aligned properly for maximum synergy.\n\nE. A at 0000 and 1203, B at 0402 and 1600, C at 0600 and 1800: This schedule does address the concern since A and B are administered at times that are close but properly spaced apart (approximately every 12 hours), allowing for maximum synergy.\n\nF. A at 0000 and 1202, B at 0501 and 1700, C at 0600 and 1800: This schedule does properly address the concern since the times are properly spaced apart.\n\nG. A at 0000 and 1201, B at 0501 and 1700, C at 0600 and 1800: Similar to F, this properly addresses the concern.\n\nGiven the concern of synchronizing A and B for maximum synergy while properly spacing their administration times, the most suitable options would either be F or G, as they both properly address the concern.\n\nThe answer is (F) or (G), but given the instructions, the most appropriate would be the first of the properly aligned options.\n\nThe answer is (F)."}, {"question_id": "ID080", "question": "You are seeing a 23 yo patient in epilepsy clinic who has had seizures occurring every hour over the last day.

However, this isn't an available option, but we can see that the closest option would be the one that implies the seizure should have occurred just a few minutes ago.\n\nThe answer is (A)."}]
