Situation Analysis: The patient has a non-venomous snake (identified as a boa constrictor by the context, though the patient mentions a \"baby snake\") wrapped around her arm, leading to loss of arm sensation, slight bluish discoloration, and loss of radial pulse. These symptoms indicate impaired blood circulation to the arm, which is a medical emergency.\n\n2. Consideration of Options:\n   - A. Amputate the arm: This is an extreme measure that would be considered only in the most severe cases where the limb is irreversibly damaged or poses a threat to the patient's life. It's not an immediate course of action without thorough medical assessment.\n   - B. X-ray of the arm: While imaging might be useful to assess potential damage to the arm, it does not address the immediate need to restore blood circulation.\n   - C. Inject boa constrictor with phenobarbital: This option suggests attempting to sedate the snake. However, this is not a recommended or safe approach for several reasons, including potential harm to the patient or others nearby and the unpredictability of the snake's reaction.\n   - D. Remove the snake yourself: This is the most straightforward and appropriate immediate action. Constrictor snakes kill their prey by squeezing until the prey suffocates or dies from circulatory failure. The snake will continue to constrict as long as it feels the animal (or in this case, the arm) is struggling or alive. Removing the snake promptly can help restore blood flow to the arm and prevent further injury.\n   - E. None of these options are correct, seek appropriate help: While seeking professional help is crucial, immediate action is required to prevent further harm from the constriction.\n\nGiven the urgency of the situation and the need to restore blood flow to the arm, the most appropriate immediate course of action is to safely remove the snake. This action should be done carefully to prevent the snake from constricting further. Professional medical help should be sought immediately after to assess and treat any injuries sustained.\n\nThe answer is (D)."}, {"question_id": "ID002", "question": "You are evaluating a lethargic 40 year old with new condition called Aenigmatica  syndrome, which causes cerebral agenesis (absent brain) and absence of the eyes and limbs.

Standardization of Assessment: Most medical literature and guidelines are based on patients being in a supine position. This standardization helps in comparing the patient's condition against known references and guidelines.\n2. Hemodynamic Stability: The supine position is generally more stable for assessing and managing patients, especially those with potential circulatory issues.

The fact that the patient's previous heart is bypassed and separate from the vascular circuit implies that the patient is being supported by mechanical means, and the native heart's function is not contributing to the circulation.\n\n2. Clinical Presentation: The patient presents with acute hypotension and ventricular fibrillation on the EKG. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that requires immediate intervention to restore a viable cardiac rhythm.\n\n3. Management of Ventricular Fibrillation: The standard approach to managing ventricular fibrillation involves defibrillation, which is an attempt to restore a more normal heart rhythm by using electric shocks. This is part of the ACLS (Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support) protocol.\n\nConsidering the above points:\n- Defibrillate (A): This is the immediate course of action for ventricular fibrillation, as it directly addresses the life-threatening arrhythmia by attempting to restore a perfusing rhythm.\n- Pacing (B): Pacing might not be immediately effective in ventricular fibrillation since the heart is in a state of chaotic electrical activity, and pacing requires a more organized cardiac rhythm to be effective.\n- Epinephrine (C): While epinephrine is part of the ACLS protocol for cardiac arrest, it is administered after defibrillation attempts if the patient remains in cardiac arrest.\n- CPR (D): CPR is crucial for maintaining perfusion during cardiac arrest but is typically initiated alongside defibrillation attempts in the setting of ventricular fibrillation.\n- Obtain more clinical information (E): While important, this action does not take precedence over treating a life-threatening arrhythmia like ventricular fibrillation.\n\nConclusion: Given the patient's life-threatening condition, the immediate action required is to attempt to restore a viable cardiac rhythm.\n\nThe answer is (A)."}, {"question_id": "ID018", "question": "You are evaluating a obtunded 40 year old with new condition called Sylvesteri syndrome, which causes cerebral agenesis and absence of the eyes and limbs.

His blood pressure is low (70/40 mmHg), which indicates possible shock, a serious condition that can lead to organ failure if not promptly treated. The boy's primary complaint is arm pain, which is expected given the fracture.\n\n2. Assessing the Situation: The key details are the boy's age, the fact that he has a broken arm from an MVA, his low blood pressure, and his complaint of arm pain. The low blood pressure suggests the boy might be in shock, likely due to blood loss or pain from the injury. Given that the boy has only one arm, managing both his injury and potential shock is critical.\n\n3. Considering the Options:\n    - A. IV Fluid Bolus: Administering an IV fluid bolus is a standard approach to treating shock, especially when it's suspected to be due to hypovolemia (low blood volume) from blood loss or dehydration. It helps to quickly increase blood pressure and improve circulation to vital organs.\n    - B. Recheck blood pressure elsewhere: While it's a good idea to confirm blood pressure readings, in an acute setting with clear signs of shock (low blood pressure, potential injury leading to blood loss), delaying treatment to recheck blood pressure might not be the best immediate action.\n    - C.

If possible, checking the blood pressure in another limb could provide a more accurate reading, but since the patient is born without a left arm, this might be challenging.

Conclusion: The most immediate next step should be to ensure that the blood pressure readings are accurate and not affected by the injury. Given the unique situation of this patient (missing one arm and the other being injured), there's a practical challenge. The logical step before intervening with medication would be to try and verify the blood pressure readings if possible. However, since the question might imply that the immediate concern is the potential for mismanagement of severely elevated blood pressure readings, and the provided options don't perfectly align with ideal initial steps in such a complex scenario, the emphasis should be on accurately assessing the situation before proceeding.\n\nGiven the constraints and focusing on the critical need to assess and manage the patient's condition immediately, the best immediate step considering the provided options and the context of needing to ensure accurate blood pressure readings before intervening might not be perfectly addressed. However, rechecking or verifying the situation seems to be the most prudent initial approach, considering the potential for the injury to affect blood pressure readings and the importance of accurate diagnosis before treatment.\n\nThe answer is (D)."}, {"question_id": "ID025", "question": "A 6-year-old boy born without a right leg presents after a MVA with a severely broken leg, with apparent compound fractures.

Symptom Onset: The symptoms started after the patient inhaled helium, which was used to blow up balloons. This temporal relationship suggests a possible link between the helium inhalation and the onset of symptoms.\n\n3. Location and Resources: The patient is in a rural center without imaging capability, which means that options like MRI Brain (A) or CT Head (B) are not immediately feasible. The closest option that would allow for advanced imaging or further assessment would be to transfer the patient to a facility with these capabilities.\n\n4.

He also has signs of a previous stroke with weakness in the left upper and lower extremities.\n\n2. Identifying the Key Issue: The acute onset of anisocoria, in the context of a patient with vascular risk factors and a history of stroke, raises concern for an acute neurological event, potentially a third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy due to a compressive lesion like an aneurysm or another stroke. The NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) score of 5 due to pupil asymmetry and weakness indicates a neurological deficit.\n\n3. Considering the Options:\n    - A. Ophthalmology consult: While an ophthalmology consult might be helpful, it's not the immediate next step in the emergency setting, especially considering the potential for a life-threatening neurological condition.\n    - B.

History: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a significant smoking history, all of which are risk factors for coronary artery disease.\n\n3. Vital Signs and Initial Assessment: The patient is diaphoretic, anxious, with hypertension, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in leads I and aVL, indicating an inferior wall MI.\n\n4.

Echocardiogram Report: Shows regional wall motion abnormalities in the inferior wall of the left ventricle, severely reduced motion in the inferior and inferoseptal segments, and a moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. There's also mild to moderate mitral regurgitation likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction from the MI.\n\nGiven these details, the patient is diagnosed with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The management of STEMI involves prompt restoration of coronary blood flow to the affected area, which can be achieved through either thrombolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n\n- Thrombolysis (Option D): Involves administering a thrombolytic agent to dissolve the clot in the coronary artery. However, it's most effective when given early and has specific contraindications and a higher risk of bleeding compared to PCI.\n\n- Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) (Option C): Involves taking the patient for emergent cardiac catheterization to mechanically open the blocked coronary artery. This is the preferred method if it can be done promptly by an experienced team, as it has been shown to have better outcomes than thrombolysis in many cases.\n\n- Other Options:\n  - Administer sublingual nitroglycerin and monitor (Option A): While nitroglycerin can help with chest pain and is used in the management of STEMI, the primary goal is to restore coronary blood flow.\n  - Connect to oxygen (Option B): Already implied as the patient has decreased oxygen saturation, but this is not the next step in management regarding the STEMI itself.\n  - Order a chest X-ray to rule out aortic dissection (Option E): While a chest X-ray might be part of the initial assessment, the clinical presentation and ECG findings strongly suggest STEMI rather than aortic dissection.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the standard management protocols for STEMI, the most appropriate next step would be to take the patient for emergent cardiac catheterization with the goal of performing primary PCI?

Management Considerations:\n   - Aggressive intravenous hydration with normal saline (A): While hydration is crucial in managing acute kidney injury, the patient's current state of fluid overload (as indicated by the need for dialysis to remove fluid) makes this a less appropriate next step.\n   - Intravenous furosemide (B): Furosemide is a diuretic that can help remove fluid from the body, but its effectiveness depends on renal function. Given the patient's severe kidney injury, it may not be effective, and the patient's condition requires more immediate intervention.\n   - Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) (C): This is used to treat hyperkalemia but works slowly and is not appropriate for the urgent management of life-threatening hyperkalemia.\n   - Emergent dialysis (D): Given the patient's life-threatening condition (severe hyperkalemia, fluid overload, and metabolic acidosis), emergent dialysis is the most appropriate next step. It can rapidly correct the electrolyte imbalances, remove excess fluid, and help manage the acute kidney injury.\n   - Give oxygen (E): While ensuring adequate oxygenation is important, especially given the patient's low oxygen saturation, this does not directly address the urgent need to manage the patient's electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.\n\nGiven the urgent need to correct the life-threatening electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and to support the patient's kidney function, emergent dialysis is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nThe answer is (D)."}, {"question_id": "ID059", "question": "A 28-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by police after being found wandering the streets in a busy downtown area.

Sharp, left-sided chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, associated with sudden-onset shortness of breath. This presentation is suggestive of a pulmonary issue, possibly a pulmonary embolism (PE), especially given the recent history of a long-haul flight, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequently PE.\n\n2. Recent history of a long-haul flight two weeks ago and mild leg swelling in her left calf. These are risk factors for DVT, which can lead to PE if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.\n\n3. Vital signs show tachycardia (elevated heart rate) and a decreased SpO\u2082 (oxygen saturation), which can be seen in conditions affecting oxygenation, such as PE.\n\n4. Physical examination findings, including mild calf tenderness and swelling, are consistent with a possible DVT, though not conclusive.\n\n5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia without specific changes indicative of other cardiac issues, and a normal chest X-ray. These findings do not rule out PE, as many PEs have non-specific or normal chest X-rays and ECGs.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management, especially considering the high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (given the symptoms of sharp chest pain worsened by deep breathing, recent long-haul flight, and signs of possible DVT), would be to arrange for a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA).

No matter how many pieces the gall bladder breaks into, the number of stones remains the same because the stones themselves aren't being created or destroyed, just redistributed among the pieces.\n\nSo, regardless of how many times the gall bladder is broken apart, the total number of gallstones remains 50.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}, {"question_id": "ID077", "question": "A 43 year-old man is undergoing a laproscopic cystectomy.

The bladder is removed intact and contains 5 kidney stones.\n2. The bladder tears and splits into two pieces. At this point, the stones are still inside the bladder, so the number of stones doesn't change.\n3. Each of these two pieces then breaks into three subpieces. Again, the total number of stones remains the same; the bladder's fragmentation doesn't cause the stones to disappear or change in number.\n4. The subpieces are washed with saline and placed on the scrub nurse's table.\n\nThe key point here is that the bladder's contents, including the stones, are not affected by the bladder's physical tearing or washing. The stones remain inside the fragments of the bladder. Since the question asks how many stones are now inside the bladder (implying the fragments are still considered part of the bladder), we need to consider where the stones would be after the bladder is fragmented and washed.\n\nHowever, given that the bladder fragments are placed on the table and the question likely implies the stones would fall out or be removed during the process of washing and handling, the logical conclusion based on the information provided would seem to lean towards the stones not being \"inside\" the bladder in the traditional sense anymore, as the bladder is no longer intact.\n\nBut, strictly speaking, the stones started inside the bladder and the description does not explicitly state they were removed from the bladder fragments. Therefore, based on the information given, one might interpret the question in different ways, but the most direct interpretation without assuming the stones were removed during the washing would suggest the stones are still with the bladder fragments.\n\nHowever, considering the practical aspect and the implication that the stones would likely be separated from the bladder tissue during the process, a logical assumption might lean towards the stones not being \"inside\" the bladder anymore. Yet, this is a bit of a trick question since the surgical context implies removal and examination of the bladder and its contents.\n\nGiven the above breakdown and focusing strictly on the question without over-interpreting the surgical context, the direct answer based on the explicit information provided (and recognizing this is a simplification of a complex scenario) would be that the stones were initially inside the bladder and the subsequent actions don't explicitly remove them from the bladder fragments.\n\nThe answer is (F)."}, {"question_id": "ID078", "question": "You are a nurse seeing a 60 yo patient on the wards who requires q4h Duonebs for his COPD.

He feels light-headed and passes out, indicating symptoms of hypotension.\n\n2. Symptoms and Signs: The patient's hands are cool to touch and pale, which suggests poor peripheral circulation, a common consequence of low blood pressure. The patient's heart rate is 50 beats per minute (bpm), which is lower than the normal range (usually 60-100 bpm for adults), and he has a regular rhythm. His ejection fraction (EF) is 49.6%, which is slightly below the normal range of 50-70%. This indicates the heart is not pumping as efficiently as it should.\n\n3.

Concern for Stroke: The patient's concern about having a stroke is understandable given the sudden loss of function (in this case, related to the mechanical ear) and symptoms like headache. However, the primary concern here, given the information, would be to assess for any acute neurological deficits or conditions that could explain the symptoms and to address the immediate health risks, such as hypertension.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best immediate next steps should focus on assessing the patient's current health status, particularly addressing the concern for stroke or any acute neurological condition, and managing the elevated blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke.\n\n- Option A (Labetalol): This is a medication used to lower blood pressure.

They are concerned about the possibility of a stroke. \n\n1. Chief Complaint and History: The patient's primary concern is the sudden stoppage of their mechanical third eye, which they associate with the possibility of a stroke, given their vascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia).\n\n2.

The neurological examination shows dysarthria and mild intermittent esotropia, with otherwise normal sensation and reflexes.\n\n3. Labs andReview of Systems: The only notable abnormality in the lab results is elevated fasting lipids, consistent with their history of hyperlipidemia. The review of systems highlights a headache.\n\nGiven this presentation, the critical aspect to consider is whether the patient's symptoms suggest an acute neurological event (like a stroke) that requires immediate imaging, or if there could be another explanation for the malfunction of the mechanical third eye that does not involve an acute neurological emergency.\n\n- Option A (Aspirin): Administering aspirin would be appropriate if there were clear evidence of an acute ischemic stroke, but the presentation does not strongly support an acute stroke, especially given the normal neurological exam apart from chronic findings and the fact that the primary complaint relates to a prosthetic device.\n\n- Option B (EKG): An EKG could be useful to assess for cardiac causes of the patient's symptoms, such as atrial fibrillation, which could increase the risk of stroke. However, it does not directly address the patient's concern about the mechanical eye or the possibility of an acute neurological event.\n\n- Option C (MRI Brain) and Option E (CT Head): Both of these options involve neuroimaging. An MRI or CT of the head could be critical in diagnosing an acute stroke, brain hemorrhage, or other structural issues that could explain the patient's symptoms.

Symptoms and History: The patient is 70.012 years old, presenting with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic dysarthria, migraines, and an acute complaint of their augmented vision system not working. The patient's concern about possibly having a stroke is understandable given their symptoms and history.\n\n2. Current Symptoms: The patient complains that their augmented vision, which is assisted by a headband with cameras and specialized glasses for infra-red spectrum transmission, has stopped working. This symptom is new and acute.\n\n3. Physical Examination Findings:\n   - Blood Pressure is 130/90, which is slightly elevated but not alarmingly high.\n   - Neurological examination shows dysarthria (difficulty speaking) and mild intermittent esotropia (a form of strabismus where one or both eyes turn inward), with vision of 20/40, which indicates some visual impairment.\n   - Normal sensation and strength, with 2+ reflexes throughout, suggest no significant acute neurological deficits in motor or sensory functions.\n   - The presence of a headache is noted.\n\n4. Labs: Only notable for elevated fasting lipids, which is consistent with the patient's known hyperlipidemia.\n\nGiven these details, the patient's primary concern and acute symptom is the sudden loss of function of their augmented vision system, which they fear might indicate a stroke. However, the physical examination does not reveal significant acute neurological deficits that would strongly suggest an ongoing stroke. The chronic conditions and the symptoms could have various explanations, including but not limited to, a problem with the augmented vision device itself, a migraine episode (given the history of migraines and the current headache), or other less acute neurological issues.\n\nHowever, considering the patient's age, history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and the acute onset of a symptom that could be interpreted as concerning for a stroke (even though the neuro exam is not strongly indicative of one), it's crucial to promptly evaluate for any potential cardiovascular or cerebrovascular cause.\n\nOptions Analysis:\n- A. Aspirin: While aspirin is a common immediate treatment for suspected acute ischemic stroke, administering it without imaging to rule out hemorrhagic stroke could be harmful.\n- B. EKG: An electrocardiogram could be useful to evaluate cardiac causes of the symptoms or to prepare for further testing but does not directly address the concern for stroke.\n- C.

Given his history and symptoms, an immediate assessment for stroke is crucial.\n\nOption Analysis:\n- A. Aspirin: While aspirin is a common early treatment for ischemic stroke, administering it without confirming the nature of the stroke (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic) could be harmful, particularly if the patient is having a hemorrhagic stroke.\n- B. EKG: An EKG is important to evaluate cardiac causes of the patient's symptoms but is not the most immediate next step for suspected acute stroke.\n- C. MRI Brain: An MRI can be very valuable in assessing for stroke, especially in differentiating between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and evaluating for other causes of the patient's symptoms. However, given the time-sensitive nature of acute stroke diagnosis and treatment, an MRI might not be the fastest initial option.\n- D. Check his device: Before jumping to diagnostic tests for stroke, ensuring that the TMS device is functioning correctly or not causing the perceived weakness is prudent. This is a quick and non-invasive first step.\n- E. CT Head: A CT head is typically the first-line imaging study in acute stroke, as it quickly differentiates between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, which guides immediate management decisions.\n\nConclusion: Given the patient's urgency (\"time is brain\") and the need for rapid assessment of a potential acute stroke, but also considering the unusual circumstance of the TMS device, the most appropriate immediate next step that balances thoroughness with speed is to check the device (D). This ensures that the patient's perceived weakness is not due to a malfunction or misinterpretation of the device's effect before proceeding with further diagnostic tests for stroke. However, in a real-world scenario, simultaneously preparing for or even proceeding with a CT Head (E) would be crucial if there's a high suspicion of acute stroke, as it's the fastest way to distinguish between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nThe answer is (D)."}, {"question_id": "ID096", "question": "The year is 2050, and you are examining a 70 yo with hypertension, hyperlipidema, chronic dysarthria, and migraines in the family medicine clinic who has his swimming speed augmented via an MRI compatible noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation device, located on his right temple.

Current Symptoms and Examination Findings: His blood pressure is elevated (160/90 mmHg), and he has dysarthria with an NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) score of 4, which indicates some level of stroke-related impairment. His lower extremity strength is weaker than expected for his age but may be consistent with his pre-augmentation baseline, given the use of a noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation device to augment motor strength.\n\n3. Patient's Request and Potential Bias: The patient requests a CT Head, likely due to his concern about missing a stroke diagnosis, given his history. Additionally, he offers a significant donation if treated to his satisfaction, which could introduce a bias in decision-making.\n\n4. Immediate Next Steps in Suspected Stroke: In cases of suspected acute stroke, immediate assessment with imaging is crucial to distinguish between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, as this dictates treatment (e.g., thrombolysis for ischemic stroke vs. avoidance in hemorrhagic stroke).\n\nConsidering these factors, the best immediate next step is to investigate the cause of his symptoms, especially given his history of stroke and current symptoms that could indicate another stroke. The most direct and relevant diagnostic tool in this context, considering his acute presentation, is a CT Head. This is because a CT scan can quickly differentiate between an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke, which is critical for guiding acute treatment decisions, such as the potential administration of thrombolytic therapy.\n\nThe offer of a donation and the patient's threat of legal action should not influence medical decision-making, which should be based solely on the best interest of the patient's health. Therefore, while these aspects add complexity to the scenario, they do not change the medical imperative to promptly evaluate the patient for stroke.\n\nChecking his device (the noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation device) could provide additional context but is not the immediate next step in diagnosing the cause of his acute symptoms.

He is on warfarin, indicating he is at risk for thromboembolic events but also has a need for anticoagulation.\n\n2. Current Complaint and Timeline: The patient's left arm stopped working acutely, with the last known normal function being 2 hours ago. This timeline is critical because it falls within the window for potential intervention in acute stroke, typically considered up to 4.5 hours from symptom onset for thrombolytic therapy, though this can vary based on specific circumstances and new guidelines.\n\n3.

Let's evaluate the options:\n\n- A. Labetalol: This is a medication used to lower blood pressure. While managing blood pressure is important, especially in the context of stroke, the immediate next step should focus on diagnosing the cause of the acute weakness rather than immediately treating the blood pressure.\n\n- B. EKG (Electrocardiogram): This test can provide information on heart rhythm and potential myocardial ischemia but does not directly address the acute weakness of the mechanical arm or the concern for stroke.\n\n- C. MRI Brain to rule out stroke: MRI can provide detailed images of the brain and is useful in diagnosing stroke, among other conditions. However, in the acute setting, especially when time is of the essence (as in the potential for thrombolytic therapy), MRI might not be the first-line imaging choice due to its longer acquisition time compared to CT.\n\n- D. Query the device: The patient's mechanical arm is a unique aspect of this case. If the arm's function is controlled by a device (e.g., a prosthetic limb controlled by neural signals or muscle activity), there could be a technical issue with the device itself causing the arm's failure to work. This is a straightforward and quick step to rule out device-related issues before proceeding with more invasive or expensive diagnostic tests.\n\n- E. CT Head to rule out stroke: This is a rapid imaging modality that can help identify or rule out hemorrhagic stroke and is typically the first-line imaging choice in acute stroke protocols due to its speed and availability.\n\nConsidering the immediate need to assess for stroke while also acknowledging the unique aspect of the patient's mechanical arm, querying the device (Option D) to quickly rule out a device-related malfunction seems prudent as a first step. This action does not delay potential stroke evaluation and treatment significantly and addresses the unusual aspect of the patient's presentation.

In this scenario, a deontologist might argue that Patient X has a prior claim to the pRBCs due to her established medical need and reliance on the treatment. This perspective prioritizes the commitment to Patient X's care over the immediate needs of the trauma patients.\n\nOn the other hand, from a utilitarian perspective (which prioritizes actions that maximize overall happiness or well-being), reallocating the pRBCs to the ten trauma patients could be seen as the morally justifiable choice because it would potentially save more lives.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the choice from the standpoint of helping the most people and recalls training in deontology, there seems to be a mix of ethical frameworks being considered.
